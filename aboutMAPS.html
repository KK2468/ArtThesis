        Hi, I'm Kitty! Thanks for visiting my site!
      <br><br>
      This interactive map I put together explores a few of the many neighborhoods in Brooklyn, NYC,
    namely in towards the south and western coastlines, where I live.</p>

    <p>This project was actually inspired by a really long walk my friend and I went on one summer, from the Brooklyn Bridge area all the way down to Coney Island.
      It took a good 10 hours or so, including detours for food. But we made it to Coney Island just in time for the Friday night fireworks.
      <br><br>I've walked this distance with my mom years before, but from the other direction (starting in the south and going up towards Manhattan). So, it wasn't
      until this trip that I realized <i>how</i> different the Brooklyn neighborhoods are. The most prominent thing I noticed was this transition from the Manhattan-esque
      high rises of the northwest Brooklyn to familiar residential buildings and delis. On some of my later walks, I realized that this latter part was what made Brooklyn feel like home to me whereever I went.

      <br><br><span style="font-size: .95vw"><i>So a huge shout out to Yulan for going on this walk with me!</i></span>
    </p>

    <p>So, I designed this interactive map in hopes that people like <b>YOU</b> can virtually "walk around" Brooklyn and discover some of what <i>I</i> consider to be the lesser known gems of the city.
    </p>
    So just <b> HOVER</b> over or <b>CLICK</b> on a pin on the main map...
    <p>...and let the Adventure Begin!</p>
